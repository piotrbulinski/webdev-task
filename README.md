# card-memory-game

## Overview
A game project built as part of of Front-end test for [Thought Foundry](http://thoughtfoundry.com/). The game requires a user to find matching pairs of cards. 

See [Web Dev Test](https://github.com/piotrbulinski/webdev-task) for more information and see [here](http://igorminar.github.io/Memory-Game/app/index.html) for an example.

### Web Test Rules
---------------------
-   You can use any code resource you like but please cite your sources. (@bhriv : Coffee cup animation with reference to this [Code Pen](https://codepen.io/LauraRobertson/pen/OpOjxB))
-   For each game pull new assets (@bhriv : I used randomuser.me to generate assets as the provided API is no longer active)
-   After each game report results and display returned message on the screen (@bhriv : API is no longer active but is set to Post results if reactivated. I played around with setting up an API to capture results and register users, but this was overkill for this test)
